# DiveLog
An application for tracking logs of dives

## Some example Xamarin projects:
* `XamarinBlank`: Very basic and limited example of Xamarin; optionally uses .Net Standard

* `XamarinTabs`: Tabs instead of menu for navigation; optionally uses Shared library

* `XamMasterDetail`: Menu instead of tabs for navigation; optionally uses .Net Standard

* `XamarinNativeIOS`: Uses a Main.storyboard instead of Views with xaml 
(It can be difficult to find and edit values in the UI using a storyboard; but this may be a good intro for those who are more familiar with native iOS app development.)
 
Some of these come with git integration pre-built in, so those might be troublesome cloning and/or building later on.
